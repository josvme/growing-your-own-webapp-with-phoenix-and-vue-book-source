# Generate Vue Typescript Application

## Getting started with VueJS and Typescript

Typescript is a superset of Javascript with support for static typing.
Static typing can help us in avoiding a category of bugs and also offer very good support with refactoring of code.
For this project we will use [vue-cli 3](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli) to generate our Vue app.
To install vue-cli, issue the following command.

```shell
npm install -g @vue/cli
```

Once we have installed, it is time to create our project.

## Creating the Project

A new project can be created using vue create.

```shell
vue create shop
```

The console will ask a few questions and once it is finished we have a bare minimum working VueJS app.
I chose Typescript, vue-router, vuex, dart-sass, babel, pwa, unit-jest and e2e-cypress. Once it is finished start the dev server.

## Starting Vue Development Server

```shell
cd shop
npm run serve
```

Now we got the vue running at [port 8080](http://localhost:8080/#/).

Ok, so now we got vue running, but how does it work ?. Lets take a dive into the basic concepts and working of Vue with Typescript.

Vue starts its execution from the _main.ts_ file inside the _src/main.ts_ file.

```typescript
import Vue from "vue";
import App from "./App.vue";
import router from "./router";
import store from "./store";
import "./registerServiceWorker";

Vue.config.productionTip = false;

new Vue({
  router,
  store,
  render: (h) => h(App),
}).$mount("#app");
```

## Routing with Vue-router

Here we make a new Vue instance with router, store and an app.
Router takes care of the routing to views according to the url.

_src/router.ts_

```typescript
import Vue from "vue";
import Router from "vue-router";
import Home from "./views/Home.vue";

Vue.use(Router);

export default new Router({
  mode: "history",
  base: process.env.BASE_URL,
  routes: [
    {
      path: "/",
      name: "home",
      component: Home,
    },
    {
      path: "/about",
      name: "about",
      // this generates a separate chunk (about.[hash].js) for this route
      // which is lazy-loaded when the route is visited.
      component: () =>
        import(/* webpackChunkName: "about" */ "./views/About.vue"),
    },
  ],
});
```

## Vue Components

As you can see here when the _path_ is /(root) we route to component _Home_. _Components_ are self-contained, reusable blocks in Vue.
Vue components have a template part, which resides inside _\<template>_ tag, where we will write html elements. Another part _\<style>_ takes care of the styling and the _\<script>_ tag part holds the logic for the component.
The files ending with _.vue_ are _single-file components_. Here we see _Home.vue_ file is imported. Lets see what is inside it, so that we know what we will get when we visit the _/_.

```html
<template>
  <div class="home">
    <img src="../assets/logo.png" />
    <HelloWorld msg="Welcome to Your Vue.js + TypeScript App" />
  </div>
</template>

<script lang="ts">
  import { Component, Vue } from "vue-property-decorator";
  import HelloWorld from "@/components/HelloWorld.vue"; // @ is an alias to /src

  @Component({
    components: {
      HelloWorld,
    },
  })
  export default class Home extends Vue {}
</script>
```

We see _HelloWorld_ imported from _components_ folder. And it is passed to _@Component_ Typescript decorator.
The _@Component_ is a decorator, which tells vue which components are used in the current component, ie. inside _Home_ component. Since we only use the _HelloWorld_, we list it there.
And we use the _HelloWorld_ component inside the _\<template>_ tag. It is like embedding the contents of that component, inside our own.
You can consider it as small building blocks which make up our current view.

Lets look at the _HelloWorld_ component itself. I omitted unimportant pieces below, like styling information and links.

```html
<template>
  <div class="hello">
    <h1>{{ msg }}</h1>
  </div>
</template>

<script lang="ts">
  import { Component, Prop, Vue } from "vue-property-decorator";

  @Component
  export default class HelloWorld extends Vue {
    @Prop() private msg!: string;
  }
</script>

<!-- Add "scoped" attribute to limit CSS to this component only -->
<style scoped lang="scss"></style>
```

## Vue Component Props

Here we see a new decorator, the _@Prop_ decorator. It is another decorator for making use of [vue props](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-props.html).
Props are messages which we pass to the components. For example here we see that we are using _{{msg}}_ inside our _\<template>_, but we haven't assigned a value to it anywhere in our component.
So from where, will we get this value ?. The props is the answer. Component which embeds this components provides it to us via props. In this case the _Home_ component gives it to us like below. Notice the _msg=...value_.

```html
<HelloWorld msg="Welcome to Your Vue.js + TypeScript App" />
```

So our _{{msg}}_ gets the value _Welcome to Your Vue.js ...._.

## State management in Vue

Store is like a database where you store data from components. The store we will use is [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/).
Vuex is a reactive store, which means all components which use a specific data will be automatically updated, if that data changes.

_src/store.ts_

```typescript
import Vue from "vue";
import Vuex from "vuex";

Vue.use(Vuex);

export default new Vuex.Store({
  state: {},
  mutations: {},
  actions: {},
});
```

We will discuss the state, mutations and actions in a later part of the tutorial.
If we notice the **main.ts** file, it passes the **App.vue** into the **render** function and mounts it to **#app** id in the **public/index.html** file.
This means **App.vue** is the main/entry file.

```html
<template>
  <div id="app">
    <div id="nav">
      <router-link to="/">Home</router-link> |
      <router-link to="/about">About</router-link>
    </div>
    <router-view />
  </div>
</template>
<script></script>
<style></style>
```

Inside the **App.vue** file we have two **router-links**. The router-link is a like a _a href_ for router.
_router-link_ modifies the router view based on this link in accordance with the _router.ts_ we discussed earlier. This results in changing of displayed **component** when the link is clicked.
This can be seen by clicking the **About** button, which points to **/about** path, which is mapped to **views/About.vue** component inside **router.ts**.

The only step left is to mount the vue to some _tag_ in HTML file, which is done by the _\$mount_. Here it mounts to tag with id _#app_.
Head over to [Official docs](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/) for an in depth explanation of Vue. The source code for client is available [here](https://bitbucket.org/Josvme/shopmanagementclient).

In next chapter, we will discuss about adding multi language support to Vue.
