# Fixing failing Elixir tests

In this chapter, we will fix the failing tests. Let's take a look at a failing test and see how to fix it. Maybe it can also be a bug in our code.

```bash
mix test test/ms/order_management_test.exs
```

Consider the below error message.

```elixir
test order_items update_order_item/2 with invalid data returns error changeset
  (Ms.OrderManagementTest)
     test/ms/order_management_test.exs:126
     ** (MatchError) no match of right hand side value:
      {:error, #Ecto.Changeset<action: :insert, changes: %{amount: 42,
       order_id: 1973, unit_price: 120.5}, errors: [product_id:
        {"can't be blank", [validation: :required]}], 
        data: #Ms.OrderManagement.OrderItem<>, valid?: false>}
     code: order_item = order_item_fixture()
     stacktrace:
       test/ms/order_management_test.exs:89: 
        Ms.OrderManagementTest.order_item_fixture/1
       test/ms/order_management_test.exs:127: (test)
```

As you can see test complains about missing **product_id** which is required. This is because our order item requires a reference to a product.
In order to fix this lets add a function to build a product, so that its product id can be passed to the order item. So the product fixture in **test/ms/order_management_test.exs** is as follows.

```elixir
  @valid_attrs_product %{name: "some name", price: 120.5, stock: 42, tax: 120.5}

  def product_fixture(attrs \\ %{}) do
    {:ok, product} =
      attrs
      |> Enum.into(@valid_attrs_product)
      |> InventoryManagement.create_product()

    product
  end
```
Since we use **create_product** from **InventoryManagement**, we need to alias **alias Ms.InventoryManagement** at the top of the file.

And now in to our **order_item_fixture** function add **product_id** as follows.
```elixir
  def order_item_fixture(attrs \\ %{}) do
    order = order_fixture()
    product = product_fixture()
    valid_attrs = Map.merge(
      @valid_attrs, 
      %{"order_id" => order.id, "product_id" => product.id}
    )
    
    {:ok, order_item} =
      attrs
      |> Enum.into(valid_attrs)
      |> OrderManagement.create_order_item()
 
    order_item
  end
```

This should fix 6 out of 7 failures, leaving **create_order_item with valid data** as the only failing one. As you notice the error is the same like before. Fix is similar to previous fixes. Take a look at code to see exactly how.

Now lets take a look at failing tests in **test/ms_web/controllers/order_item_controller_test.exs**.

```
mix test test/ms_web/controllers/order_item_controller_test.exs
```

The partial result is as follows. 

```elixir
test create order_item renders order_item when data is valid
  (MsWeb.OrderItemControllerTest)
     test/ms_web/controllers/order_item_controller_test.exs:59
     ** (RuntimeError) expected response with status 201, got: 422, with body:
     {"errors":{"product_id":["can't be blank"]}}
     code: assert %{"id" => id} = json_response(conn, 201)["data"]
     stacktrace:
       (phoenix) lib/phoenix/test/conn_test.ex:373: Phoenix.ConnTest.response/2
       (phoenix) lib/phoenix/test/conn_test.ex:419: Phoenix.ConnTest.json_response/2
       test/ms_web/controllers/order_item_controller_test.exs:63: (test)
```

The error is similar to previous case, where we lack **product_id**. Here too we add a function to create a product and an order. See the code below.

```elixir
defp create_order(_) do
  order= order_fixture()
  {:ok, order: order}
end

defp create_product(_) do
  product = product_fixture()
  {:ok, product: product}
end

@create_attrs_product %{
  name: "some name",
  price: 120.5,
  stock: 42,
  tax: 120.5
}

def product_fixture() do
  {:ok, product} = InventoryManagement.create_product(@create_attrs_product)
  product
end
```
 Also make sure we add **alias Ms.InventoryManagement** to the top of the file, as we use **order_fixture** and **create_product** from **Ms.InventoryManagement**.

Now we just change the test as follows.

```elixir
describe "create order_item" do
  setup [:create_product, :create_order]

  test "renders order_item when data is valid",
    %{conn: conn, product: product, order: order} do
    create_attrs = Map.merge(
      @create_attrs_order_item,
      %{"order_id": order.id, "product_id": product.id}
    )
    conn = post(
      conn,
      Routes.order_item_path(conn, :create),
      order_item: create_attrs
    )
    assert %{"id" => id} = json_response(conn, 201)["data"]

    conn = get(conn, Routes.order_item_path(conn, :show, id))
    assert %{
             "id" => id,
             "amount" => 42,
             "unit_price" => 120.5
           } = json_response(conn, 200)["data"]
  end
```

Here the **setup [:create_product, :create_order]** line says that the result of **create_product** and **create_order** is passed as input to the test. In this case it is **%{conn: conn, product: product, order: order}**.
The **conn: conn** is automatically injected. 

After applying a bit more polish, like renaming attributes to more meaningful names and fixing all compile errors, all our tests will pass. As the code changes are pretty trivial please take a look at the commit.

That's all folks for this chapter. In next chapter, we will see how to deploy our app to the real world.
