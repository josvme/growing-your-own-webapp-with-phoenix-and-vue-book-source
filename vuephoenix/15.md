# Deploying our application using Docker

In this chapter, we will deploy our frontend and backend using docker. During development, we have been using **mix** to build and run our Phoenix server. When we run our deploy to production, we wont be using **mix** to run our server. Elixir support **releases**, which enable to bundle our Phoenix application along with all its dependencies and even the BEAM VM if required. This allows easy deploy to a production machine. There are also many advantages to using release which are explained in detail in official [docs](https://hexdocs.pm/mix/Mix.Tasks.Release.html)

In short, it provides the following benefits.

- Code-preloading - This loads all required modules beforehand enabling the system to handle requests as soon as started.
- Self-contained - Releases can include BEAM VM, making installation of VM unnecessary on new servers. It also guarantees the correct version of VM.
- Configuration - Can be used to tune the system.

From elixir 1.9 onwards releases are built in. [Phoenix docs](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html#content) provides a step by step guide to build and deploy phoenix apps. So lets build ourselves a new release.

## Initialize a new release

A new release can be initialized as follows.

```bash
mix release.init
```

This will create the **rel/** folder at the root. They can be used to tune the system and add configuration. We will get back to this later.

In our **config/prod.secret.exs** we load the database url and secret key base as environment variables, as shown below.

```elixir
use Mix.Config

database_url =
  System.get_env("DATABASE_URL") ||
    raise """
    environment variable DATABASE_URL is missing.
    For example: ecto://USER:PASS@HOST/DATABASE
    """
```

The issue with the code is that, this code is executed on the compiling machine and copied over to releases.
In simple terms, we get value of **DATABASE_URL** from the compiling machine and it is not taken from the deployed/production machine. It is a bit strange, but it is true :).
In order to fix this, releases support runtime configuration. Follow the below steps to convert our **prod.secret.exs**, so that it is loaded at runtime and not at compile time.

1. Rename **config/prod.secret.exs** to **config/releases.exs**
2. Replace **use Mix.Config** in **config/releases.exs** to **import Config**.
3. Remove **import_config "prod.secret.exs** from **config/prod.exs** file.

The contents of **config/releases.exs** will be as follows.

```elixir
import Config

database_url =
  System.get_env("DATABASE_URL") ||
    raise """
    environment variable DATABASE_URL is missing.
    For example: ecto://USER:PASS@HOST/DATABASE
    """

config :ms, Ms.Repo,
  # ssl: true,
  url: database_url,
  pool_size: String.to_integer(System.get_env("POOL_SIZE") || "10")

secret_key_base =
  System.get_env("SECRET_KEY_BASE") ||
    raise """
    environment variable SECRET_KEY_BASE is missing.
    You can generate one by calling: mix phx.gen.secret
    """

config :ms, MsWeb.Endpoint,
  http: [:inet6, port: String.to_integer(System.get_env("PORT") || "4000")],
  secret_key_base: secret_key_base
```

As can be seen above, we need to provide values for environment variables **SECRET_KEY_BASE** and **DATABASE_URL**.

Phoenix requires [SECRET_KEY_BASE](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.Endpoint.html) to sign and encrypt data, in order to avoid tampering.
We can use the below command to generate the secret and set it as an environment variable in our system.

```bash
mix phx.gen.secret
A secret key
export SECRET_KEY_BASE=A secret key
```

Database url can be set as follows. It follows the pattern ecto://USER:PASS@HOST/database?port=portNo. Since we ran on port 5433, as opposed to 5433 we need to provide the port too.

```bash
export DATABASE_URL=ecto://postgres:postgres@localhost/ms_prod?port=5433
```

Phoenix by default doesn't start the server with releases. To support this we need to turn on server in **config/prod.ex** as follows. Just uncomment the below line.

```elixir
config :ms, MsWeb.Endpoint, server: true
```

Now we are ready to make our release.

## Compiling and build release

Follow the below commands to make release.

```bash
# Get dependencies required for production
mix deps.get --only prod
# Compile code
MIX_ENV=prod mix compile
# compile other assets like js/css
mix phx.digest
# Build release
MIX_ENV=prod mix release
```

## Starting the server

```bash
# Start the server
_build/prod/rel/ms/bin/ms start
```

Now we will get an error like below.

```
15:36:16.079 [error] Could not find static manifest at "/_build/prod/rel/ms/lib/ms-0.1.0/priv/static/cache_manifest.json". Run "mix phx.digest" after building your static files or remove the configuration from "config/prod.exs".
```

This is because we didn't run the [mix phx.digest](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Mix.Tasks.Phx.Digest.html). **phx.digest** task digests and compresses static files.
Our static Javascript files are in our client repository. So there are two ways to do this.
Either we serve the static files with a server like nginx or we use Phoenix to serve static files too.
If we use Phoenix, we have to build the files in our client repository, copy it over to **priv/static** and run **phx.digest**. Here we chose the first option. This decision, makes our elixir releases separate from our UI deployments.

## Deploying Static files with Nginx and docker

We want nginx to redirect all **/api/v1/** requests to Phoenix and all requests to Vue. Lets take a look at our nginx.conf file. Please take a look at the comments too.

```bash
server {
    listen 80;
    # Our hostname, can be changed if hosting on a domain
    server_name localhost;
    # Root of nginx
 	root /usr/share/nginx/html/;

    # All /api/v1 calls will be redirected to Phoenix
    location /api/v1/ {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:4000/api/v1/;
        proxy_set_header Host "localhost";
    }

    # Static files served from here
    # Using try_files we rewrite all url to /index.html which will be handled by Vue
    location /{
        try_files $uri /index.html;
    }
}
```

Now lets test-drive this config with an nginx docker container. Before we do this, we need to generate the JS files from client. This can be easily done using npm build.

```bash
npm run build
```

Now we have a **dist** folder at root of project with all the js/css files. We can directly mount this folder as the **root** folder for nginx. In docker it can be done as below.

```bash
docker run -p 80:80 -v <full absolute path to folder>/dist/:/usr/share/nginx/html/:ro -v <full absolute to nginx folder>/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf --network="host" nginx
```

Here we use **--network="host"** for testing purposes. This binds the nginx container to our host, so that all ports in host is accessible to nginx container. This is required as our Phoenix is running on our host machine.
Once we make sure everything works fine, we will everything to a [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) file.

As we can see everything works fine and all our apps run in production mode. Now lets write our **docker-compose.yml** file and **Dockerfile** which handles everything from building of binaries to deploying them.

## Docker file for Phoenix Server

As you know, when you need to build your own container. You need to write a [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/). This file tells docker what commands to execute to build and run our docker container.
Lets take a look at our **Dockerfile** for **backend** inside **shopmanagementserver** folder. Please check the comments inside the file.
Here we use docker [multi-stage build](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/).
This allows us to use multiple temporary containers to build our app and copying only required build artifacts from those temporary containers to our app container.

```docker
# Setup first temporary container for building elixir.
FROM elixir:1.9.2-alpine as build-elixir

# Install build dependencies
RUN apk add --update git

# Set our work directory in docker container
RUN mkdir /app
WORKDIR /app

# Install hex and rebar
RUN mix local.hex --force && \
    mix local.rebar --force

# set build ENV. This might not be necessary
ENV MIX_ENV=prod

# Install all mix dependencies
COPY mix.exs mix.lock ./
RUN mix deps.get

# Compile all mix dependencies
COPY config ./config/
RUN mix deps.compile

# Now we selectively copy all required files from local system to docker container
COPY lib ./lib/
COPY priv ./priv/
COPY rel ./rel/

# Run digest. This is not required, as we don't serve any static files from phoenix.
RUN mix phx.digest

# Build our release
RUN mix release

# Now this container will have our Elixir release compiled.
# We just need to copy it to our production container.
# We use multiple containers because, we don't want to have all
# development tools and files in our production server.

# Production Elixir server
FROM alpine:3.10

# Install openssl and bash
RUN apk add --update bash openssl

RUN mkdir /app
WORKDIR /app

# We run as root, we can change it in the future
USER root

# Copy all build artifacts from previous container. Notice the --from
COPY --from=build-elixir /app/_build/prod/rel/ms ./

# Copy required scripts to run when the container starts
COPY entrypoint.sh .

# Setting environment variables
ARG VERSION
ENV VERSION=$VERSION
ENV REPLACE_OS_VARS=true

# Make our build runnable
RUN chmod 755 /app/bin/ms

# Expose our app to port 4000
EXPOSE 4000

# These two environment variables are checked in phoenix server,
# to find the secret key and database url.
ENV DATABASE_URL=ecto://postgres:postgres@postgres/ms_prod
ENV SECRET_KEY_BASE=6jSLHKOk3s645E27EZVULIAuopigrSaiTgi+aKz7dtqKw0qRwjKWwQIkXqyyzkZc

# Set script to run when the server starts
CMD ["./entrypoint.sh"]
```

Contents of **shopmanagementserver/entrypoint.sh** is as follows.

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# Docker entrypoint script.

# Sets up tables and running migrations.
/app/bin/ms eval "Ms.Release.migrate"
# Start our app
/app/bin/ms start
```

## Running Postgres migrations from Docker

You might be wondering why we need this **Ms.Release.migrate** task in Docker and not before. In previous case we had our postgres database already setup for us by **mix ecto.create** and **mix ecto.migrate**.
In production system we don't have access to **mix**. So we need to write a migrate script in **Phoenix app** and call it before starting the phoenix app in production. We place the **release.ex** file inside **lib/ms** folder.
The contents are as follows.

```elixir
defmodule Ms.Release do
  """
  Release script for running migrations. migrate function runs all migrations
  """
  @app :ms

  def migrate do
    # Get all repos and run ecto migrate
    for repo <- repos() do
      {:ok, _, _} =
        Ecto.Migrator.with_repo(repo, &Ecto.Migrator.run(&1, :up, all: true))
    end
  end

  def rollback(repo, version) do
    {:ok, _, _} =
      Ecto.Migrator.with_repo(repo, &Ecto.Migrator.run(&1, :down, to: version))
  end

  # loads all repos for our app
  defp repos do
    Application.load(@app)
    Application.fetch_env!(@app, :ecto_repos)
  end
end
```

This can be triggered in release using **eval**

```
# Syntax is app_binary eval full_function_path
/app/bin/ms eval "Ms.Release.migrate"
```

Now when our server starts, it will have executed all migrations and hence will be ready to serve requests.

## Dockerfile for VueJS client

Similarly we need to build and run our **Client**. The contents of **shopmanagementclient/Dockerfile** is as follows.

```docker
# First temporary container to build the vuejs app
FROM node:10.16-alpine as build-node

# prepare build dir
RUN mkdir -p /app/assets
WORKDIR /app

# Manually copy all required files.
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./assets/
COPY vue.config.js ./assets/vue.config.js
COPY src ./assets/src/
COPY .env ./assets/.env
COPY babel.config.js ./assets/babel.config.js
COPY postcss.config.js ./assets/
COPY tsconfig.json ./assets/
RUN cd assets && npm install --dev --force

# Build our application
RUN cd assets && npm run build

# Our production VueJS app. We will serve it from nginx directly as they are static.
FROM nginx
# Listen on port 80
EXPOSE 80

# As you can see, we simply reused the nginx.conf we used before with a small change
COPY nginx/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
# copy all build artifacts from build-node. Notice the --from
COPY --from=build-node /app/assets/dist/ /usr/share/nginx/html/
```

The only change in **shopmanagementclient/nginx/nginx.conf** file is as follows. We will host our phoenix app in docker-compose with service name **web**. That is why we change the name of server from **localhost** to **web**. You
will see the **docker-compose.yml** file soon.

```
server {
    # All /api/v1 calls will be redirected to Phoenix
    location /api/v1/ {
        # As we run docker compose, we use name of the our phoenix service, ie web
        proxy_pass http://web:4000/api/v1/;
    }
```

Now the only step left is to combine all build docker containers with docker-compose. The contents of **docker-compose.yml** file in **shopmanagementdeploy** is as follows.

```docker
version: '3'
services:
  # Service web
  web:
    # Build file for server is in that folder
    build: ../shopmanagementserver/
    # This service needs postgres service to be up.
    depends_on:
      - postgres

  # Service client
  client:
    # Build file for client is in that folder
    build: ../shopmanagementclient/
    # Expose container port 80 to host port 80
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    depends_on:
    # For this service to work, servie web should be up.
      - web

  # Database service
  postgres:
    image: postgres
    volumes:
      # Mount ./data fro host to /var/lib/postgresql/data in container
       - ./data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    # Environment variables to be passed to postgres
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: ms_prod
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
    # Map 5432 port from container to port 5434 in host
    ports:
      - "5434:5432"
```

## Start docker compose with Nginx and Phoenix app

```bash
# Builds all containers
docker-compose build
# Starts docker-compose
docker-compose up
```

Now our server should be available at **localhost**.
Let's try to add a [new product](http://localhost/products/add). And going to [products](http://localhost/products) page, we can confirm everything works fine.

Thats all folks. In next chapter we will make our VueJS client a bit more user friendly.
